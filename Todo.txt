* Make the generating of mangalist into a thread not async method
* Make a thread that monitors new chapters for subscriped mangas and notify the user when new chapters have been uploaded
* Generate the mangalist from another program and save the combined manga string when done. Put this into the constants. 
* When used for the first time the app will save this string into a file. 
* Make an update button in the mangalistpage that finds mangas that are not in the list and then adds this string to the file.
* Do call the update button the first time the app is used to ensure that all mangas have been generated.
